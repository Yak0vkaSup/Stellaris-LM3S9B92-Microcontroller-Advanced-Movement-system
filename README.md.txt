## Overview

This project explores robotic movement control using the Stellaris LM3S9B92 EVALBOT and ARM Cortex-M3. It was developed in assembly with uKeil 5 and debugged via JTAG. Key features include:
- Precise motor control with QEI.
- Optimized use of resources via interrupts.
- Simple proportional control for PWM adjustment.
